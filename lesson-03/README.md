## ReactJS Bread and Butter
In our previous lessons we saw the following
- How to setup a React app with create-react-app
- We saw the fundamentals of React - how it works, a little bit of the diffing algorithm
- We also saw what is JSX and how we use it - so bits and pieces for us to get started with
- We saw what a React component is - types of components, what is a prop, what is state - how to set/update the state of a component
- We also saw some lifecycle methods of a React class component

Now in this lesson, as a continuation we will see the following things
- How HTML attributes differ slightly in React
- Conditional rendering with JSX
- Iterations/looping within JSX - significance of key attr when looping
- Fragments - just a quick primer
- Styling in React
