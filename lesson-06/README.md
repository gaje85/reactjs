## React Hooks
In this module we will be taking a look at React Hooks
- What are hooks and why do we need them?
- Most common/important hooks and how to use them

### Things to keep in mind
- Components end up being very complex where ideally related logic gets split across various lifecycle methods
- Class syntax maybe a little familiar for folks from non JS world, but fact is classes in JS have different behaviors and there is 
typically confusion related to `this` usage
- It's an optional functionality. Not necessarily to be used but at the same time, makes sense to use it
- Can only be used within functional components
